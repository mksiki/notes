# Ports amd Protocols 

As I am doing a machoine that involves FTP let's start with that.

## File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

> standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over the internet. It allows users to upload, download, and manage files on a remote server.
> While FTP is commonly used for website management and sharing files, it can be vulnerable to attacks if not secured, as data, including login credentials, is transmitted in plaintext.
> Hackers can exploit these weaknesses to intercept or manipulate sensitive data during transmission.

Username that can be used to login using FTP without having an account is, **anonymous.**
